## Purpose of Contract:

In this contract, we set up an escrow system by making the arbiter the smart contract itself. Tokens are given by the seller to the smart contract to sell. When a buyer wants to purchase these tokens, they send funds directly to the smart contract. When this occurs, it will cause the smart contract to transfer those tokens to the buyer, and also give the recieved funds to the seller.
